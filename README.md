## Script For Pulling Flatiron Coursework

### Disclamer

this is meant for my own personal use as I am preparing to migrate from a windows WSL2 environment to a true Linux environment

### Instructions For Setup

- First: Before installing Ubuntu I should copy all files I know I am going to need from this computer on to a USB, I should also make sure to record my wireless adapters driver information.

- Second: After following the installation procedures for [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) and booting to the new Linux OS, I should connect to the internet via an ethernet jack. Once connected I need to lookup how to install the correct wireless driver for my system that is compatible with Ubuntu. For instance I found good instructions for broadcom drivers [here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/55868/installing-broadcom-wireless-drivers).

- Third: Download preferred browser.  Here is the link for chrome, make sure to sync settings in order to keep bookmarks.

- Fourth: Download a text editor to code with.  [Here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=linux64_deb) is the link for Visual Studio Code.

- Fifth: Download/Install git using [these](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) instructions.  Use [these](https://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/first_time.html) instructions to link git cli with github account.
